# User Accounts

### Creating an invite for new users

To allow new users to create an account and join your server you must first create an invite link.

This invite link can be set to allow only a specific user or any users and can be set to expire if desired. The following steps walk through creating an invite link:

1. Log in to your admin account created during first setup
2. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard by clicking the username in the top right corner and clicking Admin Dashboard
3. Click on the Users tab on the left
4. Click on the Authentication button in the top right
5. Click on the "..." button next to "Simple (username/password)" and click configure
6. Click on "Create Invitation" and fill in the details you prefer for the invitation

Once the invitation is created you will see a new link in the invitation list, give this to whoever you want to allow on your server and they will be able to create an account and login.
